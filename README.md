# Shortest-Path-finder
Developed an interactive grid-based visualizer to demonstrate pathfinding algorithms including Dijkstra’s,
 A*, BFS, DFS, and Greedy Best-First Search.
 • Implemented real-time algorithm visualization with speed control, node color legend, and interactive
 placement of start/end points, walls, and weights.
 • Designed a responsive UI with controls for algorithm selection, grid reset, and path clearing, ensuring
 compatibility across devices
